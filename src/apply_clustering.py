### get the fingerprints
# read prepared explaining features data sheet
# draw gap statistic plot (based on config)
# based on config, apply clustering
# save the response types (observe that this are still scaled variables!)

# calculate fingerprints per group, use oversampled=False dataframe
# draw dendrogram and save the pairwise distances
## output -> excel with fingerprints, response types, dendrogram, pairwise distances
